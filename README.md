# Packaging with Spack

Repository for the [Spack exercise](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/03_building_and_packaging/spack_exercise.md). The code is a slightly modified version of the [code used in the CMake exercise](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/cmake-exercise).

The directory `docker/` contains the recipe of the Docker image that has been prepared for the exercise. It is available on DockerHub as `ajaust/spack-package-exercise`.
